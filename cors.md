# Cross Origin Resource Sharing

---

- Client side scripts (think AJAX calls in your Q1 project) make requests to other servers to access data
- Cross origin HTTP requests

- Browser's have a [same origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)
  - In the same origin policy, a script that requests data from another page must have the same URI, hostname or port number
  - The policy is designed to prevent malicious scripts from getting data through the DOM  

- CORS is a protocol to allow cross-domain data sharing
