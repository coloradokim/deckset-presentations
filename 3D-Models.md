# Mental Model Calibration[^2]
* Incident analysis 
* Blameless discussions optimized for learning 
* Not accepting human error as the cause

# Before
* Decide on an existing system 
* Pick one small part 
* Find the code or console output
* Gather your craft materials 
 
---
# During 
* Build the model
* Refer to your code or console output 
* Have fun and make mistakes 
* Talk about it
* Be done

---
# After 
* Describe what's accurate and what's not
* Record your new understandings
