# Example Topics for Technical On-Boarding: 

* git and linux commands
* yaml 
* VPC with AWS and GCP

##  Your junior engineer should independently complete large and small projects as part of their technical learning plan. 

---

## Develop systems of support and accountability for your junior SRE.
