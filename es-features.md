## What is ECMA?

**Before 1994**
European Computer Manufacturers Association 🇪🇺

**After 1994**
ECMA International- European Association for Standardizing Information and Communication Systems 🌏

^ The rise of computers began in the 1950s. At that time, there were several different computer manufacturers and each one used programming languages in different ways.

^ In order to make programming languages that would work on multiple machines, multiple manufacturers came together and agreed to collaborate and create standards around operational techniques.

^ First meeting was in June of 1961

^ Currently creates the standards for Open Office XML, Common Language Infrastructure, C# and ECMAScript

## A Brief History of JavaScript

^ Written in 1996 by Brenden Eich and worked only on the Netscape Browser

^ IE had it's own version called JScript

^ This was a nightmare for developers, because they had to write slightly different code for each different browser

^ In 1996, Netscape gave JS to ECMA so a standard would be Written

^ In 1997, the first version of ECMAscript was published
