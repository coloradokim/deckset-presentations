##  Prepare a technical onboarding curriculum that is aligned with the day-to-day work of your engineers.


--- 
# Example Topics for Technical Onboarding: 

* git and linux commands
* yaml 
* VPC with AWS and GCP 
* Docker and Kubernetes 

--- 

##  Your junior engineer should independently complete large and small projects as part of their technical onboarding.
